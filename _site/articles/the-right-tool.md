# The Right Tool

Choosing the right tools for the job is tricky. Choose a language based on your teams knowledge, what is required technically (high concurrency, speed, ease of development, etc), available talent in the market, stability in community and robustness of the tool/framework. 

For most problems, we choose to use Ruby on Rails because of all these reasons. It's very fast to market, large community, stable code base, lots of developers. Ruby isn't the fastest language but or most startups raw speed is a scalability concern and can be addressed in many ways (messages queues, abstracting away components into other tools like Node.js/Go, caching, expanding servers, compression especially assets, api driven development, etc). Often the priority in web applications is time to market over all else.
